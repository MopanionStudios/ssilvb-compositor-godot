# ssilvb-compositor-godot
An upgraded version of SSIL and SSAO (GTAO-VB) that generally matches the performance of Godot's current version. This is the testbed before I integrate it into the source code

To use this, you need to add a compositor to your world environment, and then add the "SSGI" and "SGGIBlurPass" as effects, in that order (SSGI class as the first effect, SSGIBlurPass as the second). You will need to set the "gi settings" parameter to the gi_settings resource so you can adjust parameters. A couple other things of note are that "half-res" doesnt work right now, and the temporal accumulation isn't really accumulation, it just alters the noise between frames for now because I got a little lazy lol.. The second thing to note is that both the .glsl files CANNOT be inside any folders after res:// unless you change the source locations in the gd script. If you do not want to do that, ensure you have the file paths as these when you import them: "res://ssilvb_blur.glsl", "res://ssilvb.glsl".
